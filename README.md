## Introduction

Transmission Remote GUI is feature rich cross platform front-end to remotely control Transmission daemon via its RPC protocol. It is faster and has more functionality than builtin Transmission web interface.

Transmission Remote GUI is developed using Lazarus RAD and Free Pascal compiler.

Features:

- Native application for Windows, Linux and macOS
- uTorrent-like interface
- Select files to download
- Choose files priority
- View details about connected peers
- Full information about each torrent
- Per torrent options

## Installation

The installers are listed on the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/transmission-remote-gui/transgui/releases/latest) page, and the installation instructions for different platform are listed as below :arrow_down:

### Linux

#### Easy way (recommended)

There are precompiled program's binaries for i386 and x86_64 Linux architectures.

- Download and extract the release for your architecture.

Now you can execute the `transgui` binary. *(Change the `transgui` file permissions to executable if needed)*

Additionally, you can create a desktop or menu shortcut to the transgui executable, and run the program using the created shortcut.

#### Harder way

Build the program by yourself.

1. Make sure you have working Lazarus and Free Pascal compiler installed.
  - Free Pascal Compiler 2.6.2+ and Lazarus 1.6 is used to develop Transmission Remote GUI.
2. Download the sources archive and extract it to some folder or perform svn checkout.
3. Open terminal/command line prompt and cd to the sources folder.
4. Execute `lazbuild -B "transgui.lpi" --lazarusdir=/usr/lib/lazarus/default/` command to build the transgui.res file.
5. Execute `make` command to build the application.
6. Execute `make zipdist` command to create a release .zip archive in the `Release` sub-folder.

### Windows

#### Portable zip tarball (recommended)

- Zip tarball release is much more small than the installer one, which can save you some bandwidth, disk space and time, just simply download and extract the zip tarball to wherever you want, directly execute `transgui.exe` or add shortcut for it.

**Note**: The first time you use this program, you may need to install some additional dependencies (if you need SSL/TLS enabled), including [Visual C++ Redistributable Package](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40784)([Direct link](https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/5/6/056dcda9-d667-4e27-8001-8a0c6971d6b1/vcredist_x86.exe)) and [OpenSSL libs](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries)([Direct link](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)), this only needs to be done once.

#### Installer

This installer has additional installation wizard and includes static OpenSSL libraries in every releases, the size would be much bigger than the zip tarball, but you don't need to take care of the OpenSSL dependencies.

1. Directly download the installer.
2. Run the installer and follow the steps to install it on your system.

#### Using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)

Run `choco install transgui` to install the latest version of Transmission Remote GUI.

### macOS

#### Without a package manager

This method needs no additional pre-requirement or dependency, just:

1. Download the app image from release page.
2. Open the image file to mount the image.
3. Directly run the application or drag the app icon to your disk / Application folder.

#### Homebrew

You need to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. Execute this command to install Transmission Remote Gui:

- `brew install --cask transmission-remote-gui`

## Command line parameters

You can specify path to a .torrent file or a magnet link as a command line parameter. The program will add the specified torrent.

- `-hidden` : Start the program hidden. Only the program's tray icon will be visible.
- `--home=<home_dir>` : Specifies a home directory for the program. All program's settings are stored in the home directory. You can run multiple instances of the program by specifying different home directories.

## Portable mode

If the program finds the transgui.ini file in the same folder as the binary file, then it will store all configuration and data files in the program's folder, instead of the folder in a user profile.
